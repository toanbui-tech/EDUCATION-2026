# What is the one single book that every Software Engineer must read?
Read “The Prince” by Machiavelli. Here’s why:

- You will have read something that’s not a technical manual or a novel, that has stayed relevant for more than 500 years.
- The book talks about what it takes to be a leader, the hard decisions one must make, and the cold realities one lives with.
- Your managers have probably read it, especially the MBAs - you will gain insight into how they think.
- Its advice about avoiding over-reliance on contractors (mercenaries) is on-point.
- It’s a short book.

One of many takeaways: the first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the people she has around her.
